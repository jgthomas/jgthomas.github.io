          <p>Reader, I pivoted.</p>
          <p>After spending much time somewhere between the arts and the sciences,
             I decided to learn a craft. This site represents the fruits of my apprenticeship thus far.</p>
          <p>I first encountered programming during my journey around the foothills of academia.
             Actually, this is not entirely true. I played with Visual Basic as a child,
             getting up early to shift elements around. Somehow, though, it didn't 'stick'.</p>
          <p>It has been my fortune, therefore, to pick up a child-like obsession
             with programming and computer science as an adult, with all the
             advantages and disadvantages that come with that timing.</p>
