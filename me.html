I had forgotten pretty much everything, except that I really enjoyed it. So I started playing with code again. This rapidly became a runaway obsession, which I have since ridden through another degree, volunteer work, and into my new professional life.</p><p>I could definitely have been here earlier. As a child I played with Visual Basic, getting up early to shift elements around on the family computer. Somehow, though, it didn't 'stick', that first time round. It has been my fortune, therefore, to pick up a childlike obsession with programming and computer science as an adult, with all the advantages and disadvantages that come with that timing.</p><p>So, you could say I'm something of a <strong><em>&ldquo;late developer&rdquo;</em></strong>...but I'm here now!</p></div><div class="tool-icon-list me-links me-links"><a href="https://github.com/jgthomas"><img class="tool-icon" alt="GutHub" width="26px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/78df643247d429f6cc873026c0622819ad797942/topics/github/github.png"/> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jgthomas-code"><img class="tool-icon" alt="LinkedIn" width="26px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/linkedin/linkedin-original.svg"/></a></div></div><div class="full-width"><h2 class="heading">My experience</h2><div id="experience"></div></div><div class="full-width"><h2 class="heading">My life in languages</h2><div class="profile-text lang-intro"><p>Languages are tools&#8212;implementation details for ideas&#8212;but each one emphasises something different.
