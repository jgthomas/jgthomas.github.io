          <p>Reader, I pivoted.</p>
          <p>After spending much time somewhere between the arts and the sciences,
             I decided to learn a craft. This site represents the fruits of my apprenticeship thus far.</p>
          <p>I first encountered programming during my journey around the foothills of academia.
             Actually, this is not entirely true. I played with Visual Basic as a child,
             getting up early to shift elements around. Somehow, though, it didn't 'stick'.</p>
          <p>It has been my fortune, therefore, to pick up a child-like obsession
             with programming and computer science as an adult, with all the
             advantages and disadvantages that come with that timing.</p>
          <p>You might even say I'm a 'late developer'...but I'm here now!</p>

              Languages are tools and, ultimately, an implementation detail. But each one emphasises something different.
              The ones listed here have all taught me something along the way.

                My first language! I started using Python during my PhD, running multi-agent evolutionary simulations. This might sound impressive, but
                looking back at that code now, I can tell you it is <strong>not</strong>. Still, there's something about the beauty of well-written Python code, it can flow
                almost like sentences in a natural language. Also, is there anything that <em>isn't</em> in the standard library? Just wish it was statically typed,
                once I had a taste of that, its been hard to go back.

                The major language of my computer science degree. It still feels slightly absurd that <em>everything</em> has to be a class, and do I really
                need all that for 'Hello, World!'? It was this rigidity, though, that really helped drill me into thinking in an object-oriented way. More than
                any other language, Java made me think consciously about how to create and expose abstractions.
                Grasping the beauty and power of interfaces was also a pivotal moment in my developement, so I forgive the verbosity in full.

                Coming to JavaScript after Python, does this thing even have a standard library? Who needs it when I can just pull in 10 gig of node modules, right?
                Seriously, though, it's the language of the web, and so was the key to creating my first projects that other people could actually <em>see</em>. 
                I also really like post-ES6 JavaScript, which I think does an excellent job of elegantly integrating concepts from functional programming, and cleans up
                a ton of the previous oddities. Globally scoped variable hoisting, smdh. I love you const!

                I first tried to learn algorithms and data structures in Python, but it did too much for me. What was the point of this 'linked list',
                if the Python list was right there? So I switched to C, which forced me to grapple with pointers and manual memory management, and to
                implement things myself that are just part of the standard libraries of other languages. I don't expect I'll ever work in C, but
                using it has deeply enriched my understanding of other languages and programming in general.

            <p>
                So different from any other language I've used. I bashed my head against this one for close to a year, before things started to make sense.
                The effort was worth it, though, as it opened up the entire mental landscape of functional programming for me. Haskell is also the language in which
                I've written my most significant project to date. Don't really do 'favourites', but if I did, Haskell would be my favourite language. The type system
                is amazing. Sum types and pattern matching are beautiful. As is the ability to control how much 'power' a function has, from a simple pure function,
                to selecting from the hierarchy of functor, applicative, and <strike>burrito</strike> monad.
