          <p>Hi, I'm James!</p>
          <p>This site is the record of my pivot from academic to software engineer.</p>
          <p>
            Two things happened in early 2017 that I didn't think were connected, at least not at the time.
            The first was me realising the academic world was not for me.
            The second was a growing desire for a new hobby&mdash;a creative outlet of some kind.
          </p>
          <p>
            My thoughts drifted back to the programming I did during the first years of my PhD.
            I had forgotten pretty much everything, but I did remember really enjoying it. I started playing with code again.
            What began as a hobby soon became a runaway obsession, which I have since ridden through another
            degree, volunteer work, and into my new professional life.
          </p>
          <p>
            I could definitely have been here earlier. As a child I played with Visual Basic, getting up early to shift elements around.
            Somehow, though, it didn't 'stick'.
            It has been my fortune, therefore, to pick up a childlike obsession
            with programming and computer science as an adult, with all the
            advantages and disadvantages that come with that timing.</p>
          <p>So, you could say I'm something of a <em>&ldquo;late developer&rdquo;</em>...but I'm here now!</p>

            Languages are tools&#8212;implementation details for ideas&#8212;but each one emphasises something different.
            The ones listed here, roughly in the order I encountered them, have all taught me something along the way.
