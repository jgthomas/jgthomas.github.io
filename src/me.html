          <p>Hi, I'm James!</p>
          <p>This site is the record of my pivot from academic to software engineer.</p>
          <p>
            I finally decided to learn a craft.
            The projects on this site represent the fruits of my apprenticeship thus far.
            These are all personal projects, undertaken for the sheer joy of learning,
            and have no connection to my work or formal education.

            I could have been here earlier. As a child I played with Visual Basic, getting up early to shift elements around.
            Somehow, though, it didn't 'stick'.
            It has been my fortune, therefore, to pick up a childlike obsession
            with programming and computer science as an adult, with all the
            advantages and disadvantages that come with that timing.</p>
          <p>So, you could say I'm something of a <em>&ldquo;late developer&rdquo;</em>...but I'm here now!</p>

            Starting with the SoloLearn app, answering Python questions on the bus,
            I built up to console-based games, and eventually to all the projects featured on this site. I still try to
            do some work on a personal project every day.

            Languages are tools&#8212;implementation details for ideas&#8212;but each one emphasises something different.
            The ones listed here, roughly in the order I encountered them, have all taught me something along the way.

          <p>
              My first language! I started using <strong>Python</strong> during my PhD, running multi-agent evolutionary simulations. This might sound impressive, but
              looking back at that code now, I can tell you it is <em>not</em>. Still, there's something about the beauty of well-written Python code, it can flow
              almost like sentences in a natural language. Also, is there anything that <em>isn't</em> in the standard library? Just wish it was statically typed,
              once I had a taste of that, its been hard to go back.

          <p>
              I tried to learn algorithms and data structures in Python, but Python just does too much for you. What was the point of this 'linked list',
              if the Python list was right there? So I switched to <strong>C</strong>, which forced me to grapple with pointers and manual memory management, and to
              implement things myself that are just part of the standard libraries of other languages. I don't expect I'll ever work in C, but
              using it has deeply enriched my understanding of other languages and programming in general.

              In addition to allowing me to make things other people can <em>see</em>, working with
              <strong>web</strong> tech really opened up 'API thinking' for me, as a complement to the 'algorithmic thinking' of much of my previous explorations.
              In doing so, it taught me that it was not 'cheating' if I didn't write it all myself, and that enormously powerful things can be created
              by making smart use existing tools and services, linked and chained together.

              The major language of my computer science degree. It still feels slightly absurd that <em>everything</em> has to be a class, and do I really
              need all that for 'Hello, World!'? But it was this verbose rigidity that really helped drill object-oriented thinking into my brain. More than
              any other language, <strong>Java</strong> made me think consciously about how to create and expose abstractions.
              Grasping the beauty and power of interfaces was also a pivotal moment in my developement, so I forgive the verbosity in full.

          <p>
              Learning <strong>Haskell</strong> opened up the entire mental landscape of functional programming for me.
              It is also the language in which I've written my most significant project to date. Don't really do 'favourites', but if I did, Haskell would be my favourite language.
              The type system is amazing. Sum types and pattern matching are beautiful&#8212;as is the ability to control how much 'power' a function has, from a simple pure function,
              to selecting from the hierarchy of functor, applicative, and <strike>burrito</strike> monad.
